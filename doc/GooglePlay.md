Financial management can become complicated when there is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting, regarded as income as opposed to our expenses. The first step towards better financial health, is to maintain good financial records: it's only when we have a clear understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed decision of where to cut back on our expenses. Of course there is no right or wrong answer to how spend money: here's where personal finance software comes in. They help to slice/dice the financial data to give better insight into what is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are well on your way to making every dollar count.
